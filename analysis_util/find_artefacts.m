% look if any bipolar channels of any trial contains artefacts
% INPUT
% s           - sample info information regarding the trials (what samples the trials was originated from the original recordings)            
% labels      - channel names considered 
% artefact_T  - table with the following variables
%               
%               type    name of the artefact (we have just generic artefact called 'artefact')        
%               start   sample time of the original data when the artefact starts        
%               stop    sample time of the original data when the artefact ends
%               channel channel name where the artefact was found
% OUTPUT
%
% idxChArtefact - array of booleans, the size of the array is equal to the
%                 number of channels. Every entry contains a boolean, 1
%                 artefact detected 0 no artefact for that channel
% idx_art_trial - array of booleans, the size of the array is equal to the
%                 number of trials. Every entry contains 1 if the
%                 corresponding trial contains at least one channel
%                 with an artefact, 0 no artefact

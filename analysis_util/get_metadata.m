% function to obtain metadata regarding the recordings
% if a channel contains any artefact during the recordings
% 
% INPUT
% dataDir  - root folder for raw data (data should be organized in BIDS)
% fileName - filename for which to read the metadata (.vhdr) 
%
% OUTPUT
%
% artefact_T  - table with the following variables
%               
%               type    name of the artefact (we have just generic artefact called 'artefact')        
%               start   time of the original data when the artefact starts (seconds)        
%               stop    time of the original data when the artefact ends (seconds)
%               channel channel name where the artefact was found
